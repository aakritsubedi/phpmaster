    <h1>Control Structure in PHP</h1>
    <p>
    Control Structures are at the core of programming logic. They allow a script to react differently depending on what has already occurred, or based on user input, and allow the graceful handling of repetitive tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
    In PHP, there are two primary types of Control Structures: 
    Conditional Statements and Control Loops
    </p>
    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>
    Conditional Statements allow you to branch the path of execution in a script based on whether a single, or multiple conditions, evaluate to true or false. Put simply, they let you test things and perform various actions based on the results.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>if statement</li>
      <li>else statement</li>
      <li>if else statement</li>
      <li>switch statement</li>
      <li>ternary operator</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Control Loop</h2>
    <p>
      Frequently in PHP there are instances where you need to perform repetitive tasks, such as formatting data pulled from a database, sending out emails to a mailing list, or cycling through the contents of an array. Control Loops allow you to perform these tasks almost effortlessly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>While loop</li>
      <li>Do...while loop</li>
      <li>for loop</li>
      <li>foreach loop</li>
    </ul>
